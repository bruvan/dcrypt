Dear Diary

I am very salty. I changed my password yesterday to johnnyspassword but then my PC crashed, and now my shadow entry is all wrong for some reason. Look :

Luckily, my superuser linux friend was able to fix the hash as well as the other thing that was wrong. 

Which is a good thing, because i am johnny and i was very salty.
